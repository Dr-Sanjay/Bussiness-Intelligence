Case Study: 
You are heading the team of data visualization experts  and the manager of the rapidly expanding restaurant chain ‘The Pizza Lounge’ has approached you with a problem. The restaurant chain has provided you with a large pool of data and wants to understand the customer behavior, that will help the organization make better data driven business decisions in its plans for future expansion with increased revenues. 



The data shared contains the past year’s  order details, date and time of the order placed, and the quantity ordered for each pizza of the same type and size. Furthermore, in a separate data source, the details of Pizzas such as type and category of pizza, size (small, medium, large), name,  ingredients and the price of each Pizza in USD is captured too. Using the Power BI tool, import the data from the different sources and create an appropriate data model. Clean, transform and add new variables wherever necessary. Additionally analyze and visualize the data and build a report to capture the trends in sales, do a customer segmentation and carry out a detailed financial analysis reporting last year sales, profits, etc. Build a dashboard and ensure the recommended analysis is captured as a part of the task. 



Problem Statement:


Data Extraction, Cleaning,Loading and Transformation


Extract the data from the four different files shared with you, clean, transform and load to Power BI desktop

Create a new column ‘Revenue’ that captures sales for each Pizza type.

In order to perform peak hour analysis, we will require an ‘hours’ column. Please extract the column as well as the day name from the date column.


Data Modeling:

Convert the flat files into appropriate schema for better performance of the analysis. 

Establish appropriate relationships between the tables and comment on the schema type.


Recommended Data Analysis: 
Calculate total revenue and total number of orders placed, and the count of pizzas prepared.

How many customers do we have each day? [Hint: Calculate average orders/day]

Do we see any seasonality in sales? Identify the months with highest revenues.

How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?

How much money did we make this year? Can we identify any seasonality in the sales?

Identify the top five selling pizzas. Are there any pizzas we should take off the menu, or any promotions we could leverage?

Using conditional formatting in matrix visualization, identify the peak hours for each day.
